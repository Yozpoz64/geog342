<h2>Introduction</h2>
Active transport is becoming prevalent as an effective form of exercise and climate-friendly alternative to single-occupancy vehicles. Cycling is a particularly practical way of getting around, as it is fast and cheap making it very accessible. But this accessibility depends on what kind of cyclist you are. Some areas are extremely cycle-friendly for everyone, with separated paths and other infrastructure that makes it easy to ride. Other areas that have no bike-specific infrastructure, while cycling is possible on roads, may not seem accessible to everyone. So while a local government can encourage cycling and tell us to stop driving until our ears bleed, they more than likely cannot back this up with bike-friendly policies and infrastructure. 

This introduces a need for a measure of how friendly an area is towards cycling. This may encourage people to adopt this active transport if their area is good for cycling. If an area scores poorly for cycle-friendliness, decision-makers could take a hard look at the area and make targeted funding decisions to help those that would make use of it the most. These data-driven decisions would be important, as targeted funding has the potential to improve the lives of potential cyclists due to the physiological, climate, and mental health benefits cycling brings. This would be possible if we had a standard measurement for how bike-friendly an area is so that these decisions can be made fairly, and so that people can make use of cycling infrastructure they might not know is available to them.

The need for data on cycle-friendliness is clear, and I will set to develop a standard measurement defined as cycling deprivation. Deprivation is measured extensively in New Zealand, such as the socioeconemic indexes of the [NZ Index of Multiple Deprivation](http://www.imd.ac.nz/NZIMD_Single_animation_w_logos/atlas.html) and [NZ Deprivation Index](https://www.otago.ac.nz/wellington/departments/publichealth/research/hirp/otago020194.html). I will be drawing from these concepts by using several indicators to create a final index score - in this context, of how friendly an area is towards cycling. This blog post will outline my journey from data collection to the scores of the areas I measured. I will analyse how useful the index is, and how the concept could be applied on a larger scale.

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
Due to the Covid-19 lockdown at the time of writing, I chose to analyze areas that were close to where I lived on the University of Auckland campus. Aside from Takapuna, these areas are within cycling distance. I suffered an injury that left me unable to cycle during measurement, so was only able to collect data in-person for a few of the areas, as is evident on the photos of my final map. Areas that I could not collect data for in-person were assessed using aerial imagery and Google Streetview, which gave a good perspective and judgement as they tools proved to be very effective.

Map 1 shows the areas that I collected data for to be measured against the index. The areas of interest are roughly 300m segments of road and/or pathways within the suburbs/parks/city centre that were of note. I collected most data in the form of photos, as well as noting my general impressions of each area. This includes getting impressions virtually through Google Streetview. I collated the data into a Python file that was used for all of the analysis. I used exclusively free and open-source tools to convey the re-usability and approachability of my findings. You can access my code, plots and writeups within the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Yozpoz64/geog342) that this site is being hosted on. 

<h2>Index Description</h2>
The cycle-friendliness index was built on factors that I, as a cyclist, determined to be important in how an area is approachable to any cyclist.
